# AI-Powered Task Management Application

## Overview
A web-based **Next.js 14+** application designed to enhance personal productivity through intelligent task management, AI-driven scheduling, calendar integration, and content generation.  

The system leverages **Gemini/Mistral APIs** (with fallback algorithms) to provide natural language task analysis, scheduling optimization, and content generation.

---

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Calendar:** FullCalendar.js or React-Big-Calendar  
- **Backend (API layer):** Node.js (Next.js API routes)  
- **Data Storage:** JSON file-based persistence (via Node.js filesystem APIs)  
- **Authentication:** Session-based, minimal complexity (single-user)  
- **AI Services:** Gemini API (primary), Mistral (fallback), local rules (backup)  
- **Deployment:** Any Node.js-capable hosting (Vercel/DigitalOcean/AWS)

## Core Features
1. **Task Management**
   - CRUD operations (title, description, priority 1–5, estimated time, deadline)  
   - Drag-and-drop scheduling into a calendar  
   - Progress tracking with color-coded states  

2. **AI-Powered Scheduling**
   - AI prioritization & validation of time estimates  
   - Scheduling optimization with working hours  
   - Automatic rescheduling of incomplete tasks  

3. **Calendar Integration**
   - Hourly & monthly views  
   - Read-only calendar sharing (availability links)  

4. **Content Generation**
   - Input or upload text → generate:  
     - User stories  
     - Acceptance criteria  
     - Test scenarios  

5. **Analytics**
   - Task history & audit trail  
   - Actual vs. estimated completion time  
   - Pattern recognition for AI improvement  

6. **Offline Support**
   - Cached tasks available in view-only mode

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**
  - Sub-2s load times  
  - Smooth drag & drop interactions  
  - AI responses acceptable in 3–10s  

- **Mobile Optimization**
  - Responsive Tailwind UI  
  - Touch-friendly interactions  

- **Error Handling**
  - Graceful fallback when AI quota exceeded  
  - Clear error messages for the user
