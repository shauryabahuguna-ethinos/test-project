# AI-Powered Task Management Application Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Design System (Material Design)
**Justification**: Productivity-focused application requiring intuitive information architecture, clear visual hierarchy for task states, and proven interaction patterns for complex scheduling workflows.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors (Dark Mode)**:
- Background: 18 8% 8% (deep charcoal)
- Surface: 20 10% 12% (elevated dark grey)
- Primary Brand: 240 100% 65% (vibrant blue)
- Text Primary: 0 0% 95% (near white)

**Light Mode**:
- Background: 0 0% 98% (off-white)
- Surface: 0 0% 100% (pure white)
- Primary Brand: 240 85% 55% (professional blue)
- Text Primary: 0 0% 15% (dark grey)

**Status Colors**:
- Success/Complete: 142 76% 45% (green)
- Warning/In Progress: 38 92% 55% (orange)
- Error/Overdue: 0 84% 60% (red)
- Info/Scheduled: 210 100% 65% (light blue)

### B. Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Headings**: 600-700 weight, sizes from text-lg to text-3xl
- **Body Text**: 400-500 weight, text-sm to text-base
- **UI Labels**: 500 weight, text-xs to text-sm

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Consistent use of Tailwind units 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Component padding: p-4, p-6
- Element margins: m-2, m-4
- Grid gaps: gap-4, gap-6
- Container spacing: space-y-4, space-x-6

### D. Component Library

**Navigation**:
- Sidebar navigation with collapsible states
- Tab-based views for Calendar/Tasks/AI features
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep task views

**Task Components**:
- Card-based task items with priority indicators
- Kanban-style columns for task states
- Compact list view with quick actions
- Task detail modal with full editing capabilities

**Calendar Integration**:
- Month/week/day view toggles
- Time slot grid with drag-drop zones
- Task overlay badges on calendar dates
- Interactive scheduling popup

**AI Features**:
- Clean input form for content generation
- Suggestion cards with accept/reject actions
- Progress indicators for AI processing
- Generated content preview panels

**Data Displays**:
- Progress bars for task completion
- Statistics cards with key metrics
- Timeline view for task history
- Priority matrix visualization

**Forms & Controls**:
- Floating labels for input fields
- Date/time pickers with calendar popups
- Priority selection with visual indicators
- Rich text editor for task descriptions

### E. Animations
Minimal, purposeful animations only:
- Smooth card hover elevation (subtle shadow increase)
- Calendar date selection highlight
- Task drag-and-drop visual feedback
- Modal/drawer slide transitions

## Key Design Principles

1. **Information Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between task priorities, states, and deadlines using color and typography weight
2. **Efficient Workflows**: Minimize clicks for common actions like task creation, scheduling, and status updates
3. **AI Integration**: Seamlessly blend AI suggestions into natural workflows without disrupting user flow
4. **Responsive Calendar**: Ensure calendar functionality works effectively on both desktop and mobile devices
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential task information by default, detailed views on demand

## Visual Treatment
Clean, modern productivity aesthetic with emphasis on readability and quick visual scanning. Use Material Design elevation principles for component layering and focus states. Maintain consistent spacing and alignment across all views to create a professional, trustworthy interface suitable for daily productivity use.
